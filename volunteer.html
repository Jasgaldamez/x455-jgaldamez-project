                  The Pet Pals Program gives the community the tools needed to help reunite pets with their owners "in the field" before they are taken to the shelter.  One of the most effective ways to do this is to check for a microchip, followed by checking social media for lost pets.

                <p class="panel">
                  We are looking for a mix of individuals and businesses who are willing to assist the public with scanning lost pets for a microchip and helping reunite pets with their families.  Training and support will be provided for those selected to participate in the program. As a Pet Pal, members of the public may contact you to have a found pet scanned for a microchip and for help reuniting a pet with its family.
